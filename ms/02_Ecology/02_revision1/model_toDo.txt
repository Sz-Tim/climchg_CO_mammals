# Ecology review 1
# Bessinger comments


## Main critiques:
- testing with simulated datasets
	- previously:
		- generate ranges
		- generate true abundances in each bin
		- sample from each bin
	- generate communities across eras
		- repurpose Ricker models
		- each species from 1950 - 2010
		- lambda ~ Temp + precip (?)
		- shift Temp starting at 1980
	- simulate sampling

- sensitivity analyses
	- elevational bin width
	- detection probability
	- relative abundance distribution
	- absolute abundance distribution
	- difference in total detections between eras

- testing with real datasets
	- compare contemporary with an occupancy model?
		- would mean we couldn't use supplemental museum specimens

- statistical theory (?)

- expansions
	- incorporate uncertainty into detection probabilities
		- set as prior distributions
